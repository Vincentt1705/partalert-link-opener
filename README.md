WARNING: SELF-BOTTING IS AGAINST DISCORD TOS AND THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY TO GET BANNED FOR IT EVEN IF THE CHANCE IS LOW!
    Using this script is at your own risk!  
  
This script automatically opens links from embedded messages sent by the PartAlert bot in the PartAlert Discord server. IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING RELATED TO PURCHASING!  
It's the same idea as sheppyh's script but I started fresh and did it my own way instead of like the way clearyy did it (where sheppyh forked from).

# How to use:  
1.   Download Python 3.7 or higher and before installing make sure to check 'Add Python to PATH'.  
2.   When you're done installing Python, open CMD and install the discord module by typing:  

> pip install discord.py  

3.    Download this repository to your computer (https://github.com/Vincentt1705/partalert-link-opener)  
      Make sure the repository is unpacked (not in .zip form)
4.    Right click opener.py and click on 'Edit with IDLE'.  
5.    Once you've opened the script, do the following things:
* Add your Discord token, see how in the following video: (use v9 instead of v6 used in the video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI1lzqzLQCs
* Remove all the roles that you don't want to open links from. (It will only open links from messages tagged with one or more of those roles)
* Remove channels that you don't want to open links from. (Only channels that you're actually in will open)
6.    Save the file and doubleclick the run.bat file to start the script.
7.    Wait for the script to automatically open links sent in the chosen discord channels with wanted role tags.

# Help  
The script is made for and on Windows.  
For help message me on Discord @Vincentt#1705 (in the PartAlert server).
